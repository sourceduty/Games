Ocean Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a submarine with lasers by moving it horizontally
across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending squids. The aim is to defeat five rows of ten squids that move
horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats a squid,
and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more squids are defeated, the squids' movement and the game's music
both speed up.

The squids attempt to destroy the submarine by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom,
the squid invasion is successful and the game ends. A special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top of the
screen and award bonus points if destroyed. The ship is partially protected by several stationary defense bunkers that are
gradually destroyed by projectiles from the squids and player.
